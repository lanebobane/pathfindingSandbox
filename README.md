PathfindingSandbox.js
==============
#### A first look into Pathfinding.js, library I may use for my Capstone Project ####

Introduction
------------

The aim of this project is to satisfy simple user-stories having to do with determining the shortest
path to fetch a list of items.

User Stories
------
1. As a thing-fetcher, I can provide a list of things and an intended search area and will be given
an optimal path to follow to retrieve them.
2. If my intended search area does not contain all items on my list, I am told which items are not
present.

Demo
------

An [online demo](http://www.google.com) can be found to showcase the functionality of this project.
